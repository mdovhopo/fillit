# fillit
My(and my teammates) implamantation of fillit project of 42 cursus.<br />

Fillit is a project that let you discover and/or familiarize yourself with a recurring
problematic in programming: searching the optimal solution among a huge set of possibilities,
in a respectable timing. In this particular project, you will have to find a way to
assemble a given Tetriminos set altogether in the smallest possible square.
A Tetriminos is a 4-blocks geometric figure you probably already heard of, thanks to
the popular game Tetris.<br />

Fillit is not about recoding Tetris, even if itâ€™s still a variant of this game. Your program
will take a file as parameter, which contains a list of Tetriminos, and arrange them
in order to create the smallest square possible.<br />

It have some problems with speed more then 12 piaces, need some optimisation
